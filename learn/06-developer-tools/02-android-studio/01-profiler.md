## 📚 Theory
### CPU Profiler — Find Slow Functions
View → Tool Windows → Profiler → CPU. Record a trace, see flame graph of function calls. Find bottlenecks.
### Memory Profiler — Detect Leaks
See real-time heap usage. Force GC. Dump heap and inspect objects. Track allocations.
### Network Profiler — Monitor API Calls
See all network requests, response times, payload sizes. Identify unnecessary calls.
### Compose-Specific: Recomposition Counts
